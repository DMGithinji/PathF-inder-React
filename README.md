# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Description
Welcome to Pathfinder! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to challenge myself by visualizing them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://reactpathfinder1.firebaseapp.com

### Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

- A Search* (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Cloning and running
Clone the application using git clone(this copies the app onto your device). In your terminal:

$ `git clone https://github.com/DMGithinji/PathFinder-React.git`

$ `cd path-finder`

$ `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

$ `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
